Notable changes to the Unigox partner API, newest first.

**Offramp orders now validate the recipient details before the order is created.**

For payout corridors with recipient requirements (e.g. mobile money and bank transfers in Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya), `POST /api/v1/partner/offramp/initiate` now checks the recipient up front:

- If a required recipient field is missing or malformed, the request is rejected with **`422 RECIPIENT_UNVERIFIABLE`** and the offending fields are listed in `error.details.fields` — so you can fix the details and create a new order, instead of creating one that can't be paid out.
- Name requirements are corridor-specific: bank transfers expect the account-holder name, while mobile money pays to the number and accepts a placeholder name.
- This confirms the recipient details are complete and well-formed; it does not by itself guarantee the destination account exists. If the up-front check can't be completed, the order is still created and the recipient is re-checked before payout — so an outage never blocks order creation.

Corridors without recipient requirements are unchanged; no action required.
